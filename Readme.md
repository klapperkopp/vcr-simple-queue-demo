# Prerequisites

- Install and configure the vonage cloud runtime CLI (neru CLI) from https://vonage-neru.herokuapp.com/neru/guides/cli

# Initial Setup

1. Run `neru app create --name "vcr-simple-queue-demo"` and copy application id (only if you don't have an app yet)
2. Run `cp neru.yml.example neru.yml && cp .env.example .env` and copy application id and any missing env variables into neru.yml and .env
3. Run `neru app configure --app-id [YOUR_APP_ID]` (this is only needed if you want to process inbound requests)
4. Run `neru secrets add --name INTERNAL_API_SECRET --value "$(openssl rand -hex 12)"` (this will be only internally used at the moment, should be a secure random hash or equal)

# Optional Addons

You can install optional addons by setting certain envrionment variables in neru.yml to true. Please see the respective plugin readme files to find out more. Some plugins might come with additional API endpoints that are described in their readme files.
